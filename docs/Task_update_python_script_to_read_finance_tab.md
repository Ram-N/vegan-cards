read the task update 

0. I am working towards a new Feature_Card_types (in docs). Read that file.

1. Read the Python script `scripts/convert_activities_in_sheets_to_JSON.py` (aka Original Python script)
2. Goal: To update `scripts/convert_to_json2.py` to A. Read from 2 tabs. B. Incorporate the 3 new columns in the Financial tab into the JSON.
3. Make code changes to json2.py only.
4. Add argparse exactly as in Original Python script
5. Make sure the output goes to the src/data/activties directory.

Please ask if something is not clear.

Create a nice Tasks.md in docs for me to review.
